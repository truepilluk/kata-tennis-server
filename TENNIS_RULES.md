# Tennis Scoring

The rules for scoring a tennis game are as follows:

1. Players start on 0 points
2. As players score points their score increases as follows:

| Points | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| 0      | 0     |
| 1      | 15    |
| 2      | 30    |
| 3      | 40    |

When a player scores a 4th point they win the game unless the other player also has 4 points in which case the following applies...

## Deuce

If the score reaches 40-40, this is known as "deuce" and the players must now win by scoring 2 clear points

The player scoring the next point gets a score of "Advantage" which should be recorded as an "A"
Now 1 of 2 things may happen:

1. Player 1 scores and wins the game
2. Player 2 scores, this takes the scores back to deuce (40-40)

An example game might continue as follows
| Player 1 | Player 2 | Scoring player |
| -------- | -------- | --- |
| 40 | 40 |
| A | 40 | Player 1
| 40 | 40 | Player 2
| 40 | A | Player 2
| L | W | Player 2
